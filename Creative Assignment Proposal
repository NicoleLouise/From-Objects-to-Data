Requirements
For this course, students are required to submit, individually, a proposal for a group project

During the second half of the course, groups (up to 4 students per group) choose one of their proposals, conduct their research project and present their findings during the final lab session.

Groups hand in a portfolio with all their project materials and a written report.

The project proposal should contain:

two or more research questions regarding a data set (can be a data set used in the course or another data set of choice)
a high-level description of methods and steps to investigate this
a description of how results of investigation can answer or shed light on research questions
The proposal is an individual assignment. Each student should hand in their own proposals, which should be no longer than 1 page A4

The portfolio should include:

scripts that produce results from the original data set
a report containing:
explanation of your research question, approach, analysis and interpretation of the results
a reflection on lessons learned. This may include visualisations of the results.
The portfolio is a group assignment, in the form of a gitHub repository with separate files for scripts and documentation.

Report should not exceed 2500 words.
